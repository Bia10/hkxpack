Apaprently, the data is organized differently from what I thought :

 - Members have a flage value, that can be either NONE or SERIALIZED
 - Serialized memebrs must not be included in data mining, but <could ?> be included as comment in the output XML.
 - Data3 seems to contain the actual class architecture, while data2 and data1 contains respectvely enums (?) and actual data.
