What we know (from Highflex's Havok2FBX tool) :

 - Animations conversion software use the following files to create the actual animation data :
	A skeleton
	An animation file

 - The output can be put in a FBX fle, which will then be self-sufficient.
	An FBX file contains : 

There is a number of members that can be related easily to each other :

hkaSplineCompressedAnimation [#92]:
	Number of transform tracks <=> annotation tracks (size)
	Num frames <=> reference Frame samples (size) of target extractedMotion
	maxFramesPerBlock * frameDuration => blockDuration
	1 / blockDuration => blockInverseDuration
	duration <=> blockDuration * numFrames / maxFramesPerBlock
	
hkaAnimationBinding [#94]:
	Transform Track To Bone Indice (size) <=> number of Transform Tracks of target animation
	
Compressed Spline :

	B-Splines, or NURBS, are a way to store data in "knots". In addition to this storage, there is a way to remove some of the nodes and replace it by extra data less costly in weight. There is also a general compression algorithm.

	=> the algorithm may be protected behind some patent or commercial secret. In this case, it may not be possible to write an open-source converter.
	=> There is also the posibility that the algorithm is publicly available, through research papers.
