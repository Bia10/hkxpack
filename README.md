# HKXPack

HKXPack is a tool to 'pack' and 'unpack' to and from hkx files, which is the Havok compressed file format.

It was made to be used with the hk\_2014.1.0-r1 file format, commonly used in Fallout 4. Given the opportunity, support for hk_2010.2.0-r1 or other hkx format may be added.

The output format is intended to be TagXML, outputted by hkxcmd (https://github.com/figment/hkxcmd).

# How to

This section is empty because the software isn't yet functionnal. It will be updated as time goes on.

# Informations

The tool was written in Java, and was intended to be a proof of concept 

You may find all available information under /doc. It contains mostly analysis and comparison of the hkx files as well as some architectures of the hkxpack software.

You might find out that some of the data required to run the tool is missing. That's because the 'classXML' files are obtained from the Fallout 4 game. You'll need the game to retrieve the files and, to prevent possible legal issues, they're not included in the sources.

# Contributions

Thanks to Figment for his help to obtain information about the hkx classes. Without him, none of this would be possible.  
Thanks to CPU for his overall help with making this project.  
Thanks to the people from the NifTools IRC for helping with part of the project.
